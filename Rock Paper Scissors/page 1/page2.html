      Rock paper scissors (commonly scissors, paper, rock, or stone in Australia and the UK)
      is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player 
      simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" 
      (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle 
      finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game originated 
      in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, 
      before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

      A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who 
      decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or "breaks 
      scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
      a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape,
      the game is tied and is usually replayed to break the tie.

      Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing 
      straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection 
      methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with some degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random 
      behavior in opponents.
